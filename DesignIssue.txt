#Design issues
	i) No Base class for initialization of driver, properties, launch browser, pageload timeout, maximize window, delete all cookies, get(url).
 	ii) No config.properties file for common variables. 
 	iii) Test class are there in src/main/java, should be in src/test/java.
 	iv) No page class defined.
 	v) No utility class defined for common methods, which can be used through out the classes.
 	vi) Each test case has driver initialization code and driver reference to chrome driver. Same code on all 3 test class.
 	vii) No link in between all pages test.
	vii) setDriverPath(), only setting for chrome, if there are safari/firefox/microsoftEdge/InternetExplorer browsers... then there will be so many combinations.

#FlightBookingTest class Issues: -
	i) It is home page, to search flight(wrong class name).
	ii) Some element locator wrong(could not locate element).
	iii) Date element locator wrong.
	iv) WebElement selection as 1st element wrong from List<WebElement>.
	v) Assertion do exactly find whether correct search is done or not? it will not compare the for searching was correct or not.
	vi) Thread.sleep() should not be used, when we can use explicit and implicit wait. Here everywhere implicit wait is working fine. so did not put explicit wait .
	vii) Origin, destination, date are hard coded.
	viii) FlightBookingTest class should be FlightSearch named, it is searching for flight not booking.
	ix) No link in between FlightBookingTest class and other two classes.
	x) wrong validation.
	

#HotelBookingTest class issue: - 
	i) No selection for dates.
	ii) No selection for item from list in localityTextBox after sendKeys().
	iii) No Validation point for test case. 
	iv) No checkInDate and checkOutDate. 
	vi) No selection of element from localityTextBox which comes dynamically.
	vii) WebElement not initialized.
	
#SignInTest class issue: -
	i) Same code for setDriverPath() and driver initialization again.
	ii) Not switched to signIn frame before clicking on signIn button.
	iii) id - error is wrong for message("There were errors in your submission").
	iv) Use of ThreadSleep().
	v) No link in between home page and signInTest page.

Enhancement:- 
	i) Created 1 base class as parent class for all classes for initialization of driver, properties, launch browser, pageload timeout, maximize window, delete all cookies, get(url).
	ii) Test base class will be parent class of all classes (all page class, all pageTest class, utility class).
	iii) Created 1 config.properties file (url, browser, operating system, timouts, environment variables, checkIn/out Date, origin, destination, travel date etc.)
	iv) Removed browser.exe file from the test-output folder and used Bonigarcia dependency for key and value of system.setProperty(key, value).
	v) created src/test/java - has all pageTest classes.
	vi) create src/main/java for base, config, util and all page class.
	vii) Created 1 util package for all common utility. (Created common methods which were used repeatedly. (setDriverProperty(), selectDate(), fillLocation(), clickOnSearchButton())
	viii) Created Page class (FlightSearchPage, HomePage, HotelSearchPage, SearchedHotelPage, SignInPage) for variables(elements), methods(to work on elements). 
	ix) Created PageTest class (FlightSearchPageTest, HomePageTest, HotelSearchPageTest, SearchedHotelPageTest, SignInPageTest) for all page test case.

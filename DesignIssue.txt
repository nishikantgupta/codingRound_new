#Design issues
1) Created 1 base package for the followings.
	i) Testbase class will be parent class of all classes (page class, pageTest class, utility class).
	ii) Prerquisite (initialization of driver, properties, launch browser, pageload timeout, maximize window, delete all cookies, get(url))
2) Created 1 config.properties file (url, browser, operating system, timouts, environment variables) 
3) created src/test/java - has all pageTest classes.
4) Created 1 util package for all common utility (generic functions)

Still so many modifications need to make, will keep updating the file.

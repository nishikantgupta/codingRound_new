#Design issues
1) Created 1 base package for the followings.
	i) Testbase class will be parent class of all classes (page class, pageTest class, utility class).
	ii) Prerquisite (initialization of driver, properties, launch browser, pageload timeout, maximize window, delete all cookies, get(url))
2) Created 1 config.properties file (url, browser, operating system, timouts, environment variables) 
3) created src/test/java - has all pageTest classes.
4) Created 1 util package for all common utility (generic functions)
5) Each Testcase has driver initialization code and driver reference to chrome driver. Same code on all 3 test class.


#FlightBookingTest class Issues: -
	i) It is home page, to search flight(wrong class name).
	ii) Some element locator wrong.
	iii) Date element locator wrong.
	iv) WebElement selection as 1st element wrong.
	v) Assertion do exactly find whether correct search is done or not?
	vi) Thread.sleep() should not be used, when we can use explicit and implicit wait. Here everywhere implicit wait is working fine.
	vii) I have put origin/destination/travelDate in properties file.
	viii) Deleted FlightBooking class, since it was wrong name(felt so).
	viii) Created HomePage for variables(elements), methods(to work on elements). HomePageTest for each Page validations.
	ix) Create SearchPage and SearchPageTest Class as well for validation where correct search is done or not.  
	x) No validation point for searched flights.
	xi) Created common methods which were used repeatedly. (setDriverProperty(), selectDate(), fillLocation(), clickOnSearchButton())

#HotelBookingTest class issue: - 
	i) No selection for dates.
	ii) No selection for item from list in localityTextBox after sendKeys().
	iii) No Validation point for the search done for hotel. 
	iv) Created 4 classes (HotelSearchPage, HotelSearchPageTest, SearchedHotelPage, SearchedHotelPageTest)
	v) Put entry of checkInDate and checkOutDate in properties file. 

Enhancement:- 
	i) Removed browser.exe file from the test-output folder and used Bonigarcia dependency for key and value of system.setProperty(key, value).
Still so many modifications need to make, will keep updating the file.
